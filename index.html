    <h1>What Is Covid-19 ?</h1>
    <p>
      Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly
      discovered coronavirus. Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will
      experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without
      requiring special treatment. Older people, and those with underlying
      medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic
      respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious
      illness. The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is be well
      informed about the COVID-19 virus, the disease it causes and how it
      spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by washing your hands
      or using an alcohol based rub frequently and not touching your face. The
      COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge
      from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes, so itâ€™s important
      that you also practice respiratory etiquette (for example, by coughing
      into a flexed elbow).
